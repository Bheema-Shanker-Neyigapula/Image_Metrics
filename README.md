Here's a Python project that calculates various image quality and similarity metrics using popular libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and Scikit-image. The project supports the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
Entropy
Variance
Mean Intensity
Histogram Uniformity
Feature Similarity (ResNet-18)
Spectral Norm
Inception Score
